# earthengine-gef-tutorials

#### This repository is a collection of tutorials for GEF data collection on Google Earth Engine (GEE). Tutorials are sorted by project ID, and they walk through the collection process for each relevant boundary. Some tutorials require imported data, and those datasets can be found in the "data" folder.
