# earthengine-gef-tutorials

# This repository is a collection of tutorials for GEF data collection on Google Earth Engine (GEE). Tutorials are sorted by project ID and walk through the collection and eventual export of each boundary as a shapefile. Some tutorials required imported data, and those datasets can be found in the "data" folder.
